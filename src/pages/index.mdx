## Origin Sentinel is an Al platform that aggregates multi-source information, processes the raw data, and provides critical intelligence in real-time. {{ date: '2023-03-17T00:00Z' }}

Origin Sentinel is powered by billions of data points and leverages cutting-edge public and proprietary records technology to locate hard-to-find information and quickly identify concerns associated with people, businesses, and assets.

Sentinel assists government agencies and NGOs with locating and monitoring individuals associated with criminal activity and other adverse actions,

Sentinel works in the background 24/7/365 to ensure our clients can make critical decisions using the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### <SparkleIcon /> How Sentinel Works

Origin collects and monitors data from thousands of sources including public records, international sanctions and blacklists, civil and criminal records, utility data, SEC and other corporate records, global news, social media, and more.

Then, our proprietary machine learning engine and artificial intelligence svstem filters irrelevant and duplicate data, identifies red flags, and forms meaningful connections between key data points. Simultaneously, our system compiles and analyzes unstructured data, such as news articles, blogs, and social media, to extract and identify significant data

Finally, our experienced intelligence analysts verify the data and provide critical updates to our clients in real-time. The final step is essential to ensure accuracy, regulatory compliance, and to bring clear meaning to complex information.

## Dark mode support {{ date: '2023-03-06T00:00Z' }}

I released this thing last week hoping a couple of people would say "awesome job" and make me feel good about what I'd built but instead I just got a ton of people shaming me on Twitter for being such a horrible person for only shipping a light UI.

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements

- Added dark mode support
- Improved input field responsiveness when writing a commit message in a project with a large number of changed files
- Made keyboard shortcut for opening the Commit window customizable
- Deleted my Twitter account

## Commit v0.1.0 {{  date: '2023-03-03T00:00Z' }}

Commit is a command palette-style Git client you can pull up from anywhere with a keyboard shortcut that makes it really easy to commit your work. It uses the "last modified" timestamp of the files in all of your projects to automatically know which project you're in the middle of working on, so any time you pull up the UI it's already got the right project selected â€” you just have to type your commit message, hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> and your changes are captured.

I'd be lying if I really thought this was that useful but I was looking for an excuse to learn macOS development and here we are. It's open source at least so maybe you can find something interesting in the code even if the app itself is a total waste of hard drive space.
